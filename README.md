# Workout Planner

## Live deployment is available [here](https://workout-exercise-planner.herokuapp.com/)

Submission for Code Institute's Data-Centric Development Milestone Project, an application for the planning and logging of workout sessions.

## User Experience

### Target Audience

- People interested in planning their workouts.
- People who want to record their workouts in a list.
- People who want to view or follow others' exercise lists.

### Project Suitability

This project is a suitable way to deliver this content because:

- An authentication feature enables ownership of settings and objects.
- Selective permissions limit user interaction with exercises they are not the owner of, preventing unauthorised editing or removal of others' exercises.
- Users have the ability to create, view, edit or delete their own exercises, and ability to clone others' exercises to their own list.
- Users can "follow" other users, and display followed users' exercises in a filtered list.

## User Stories

1. As a new user I want to create an account.
2. As an established user I want to login to access my exercises.
3. As a logged-in user I want to create a new exercise.
4. As a logged-in user I want to edit one of my exercises.
5. As a logged-in user I want to delete one of my exercises.
6. As a logged-in user I want to clone another user's exercise.
7. As a logged-in user I want to mark my exercise as complete.

### User Story Fulfilment

## Design & Styling

### Colour Palette

The initial website design concepts have been formed with the following colour palette:  
![#0f1011](https://placehold.it/15/0f1011/000000?text=+) `#0f1011`  
![#615F5B](https://placehold.it/15/615F5B/000000?text=+) `#615F5B`  
![#A2A29F](https://placehold.it/15/A2A29F/000000?text=+) `#A2A29F`  
![#FBFBFB](https://placehold.it/15/FBFBFB/000000?text=+) `#FBFBFB`  
![#2B5630](https://placehold.it/15/2B5630/000000?text=+) `#2B5630`  
![#04A647](https://placehold.it/15/04A647/000000?text=+) `#04A647`

The chosen palette defines the site as a predominantly dark-themed design with lighter colours used to highlight / segment components.
